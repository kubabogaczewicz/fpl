# File-based Photo Library (fpl)

## CLI script for easier maintenance of file-based photo library

I like my photos organized in separate folder for each year, with filenames being simply date and time the photo was taken. Additionally I want my photos to include GPS tags â€” if a photo is missing them I manually add them with GeoTag.

This script eases with automatic renaming and validating that GPS tags are filled in.
